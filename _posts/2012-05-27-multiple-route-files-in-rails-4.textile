title: Multiple Route Files in Rails 4
---

h1. {{ page.title }}

Often in our Rails applications, we end up with a very long <code>config/routes.rb</code>. The application that I am currently working on has a routes file with over 470 lines. As the number of lines grow, the routes file becomes difficult to maintain. Searching where a particular route is defined also becomes quite difficult.

With commit "6acebb38":https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/6acebb38bc0637bc05c19d87f8767f16ce79189b made by Yehuda Katz, we can specify multiple route files under <code>config/routes/</code> directory in our application.

Lets say originally our <code>config/routes.rb</code> looks like:

{% highlight ruby %}
# config/routes.rb
Tesapp::Application.routes.draw do

  resource :session

  resources :comments
  resources :posts
  resource  :profile

  namespace :admin do
    resources :comments
    resources :users
    resources :posts
  end

  root :to => "welcome#index"
end
{% endhighlight %}

We can move _admin_ related routes into its own route file to <code>config/routes/admin.rb</code>.

{% highlight ruby %}
# config/routes/admin.rb

namespace :admin do
  resources :comments
  resources :users
  resources :posts
end
{% endhighlight %}

And we tell Rails router to pick _admin_ routes from that file using <code>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Resources#draw</code> in <code>config/routes.rb</code>.

{% highlight ruby %}
# config/routes.rb

Tesapp::Application.routes.draw do

  resource :session

  resources :comments
  resources :posts
  resource  :profile

  draw :admin

  root :to => "welcome#index"
end
{% endhighlight %}

<code>#draw</code> will try to find a file with the same name as the symbol passed to it and simply call the route generator methods present in it. This way we can make our routes file more manageable and concerned only with one aspect of our application.

Routes will be drawn in the order <code>#draw</code> is called. The routes that are <code>draw</code>n earlier will take precedence over the routes drawn later.
