<div id="about">
  <p>
    Hi I'm Waseem Ahmad. I'm a Ruby/Rails developer based in New Delhi.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently I'm employed at <a href="http://vinsol.com/">Vinsol</a> where I worked on <a href="www.infomob.com">Infomob</a>, a Nigeria based local business listings search engine. These days I'm working on <a href="http://ideeli.com">Ideeli</a>, a flash deal website specializing in apparel and fashion accessories. Apart from application development, I also take care of mentoring, training and performing code reviews at Vinsol.
  </p>

  <p>
    From December 2008 to February 2011 I worked on <a href="http://5amily.com">5amily.com</a>. 5amily, pronounced <em>family</em>, is a Genealogy based social networking application that lets people connect with their relatives.
  </p>

  <p>In my free time I try to contribute to Open Source projects like <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/waseem-ahmad/commits">Ruby on Rails</a>. I've also contributed to Ruby gems like <a href="https://github.com/arsduo/koala">Koala</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mmangino/facebooker">Facebooker</a>. And hey, I also created a Rails plugin <a href="https://github.com/waseem/joey">Joey</a> which I no longer maintain :(.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also help people at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/100466/waseem">Stackoverflow</a> and IRC in #RubyOnRails channel on Freenode. I prefer IRC over Stackoverflow because of the amount of interactivity involved. You can find me in #RubyOnRails channel as <em>waseem_</em>. I'm a Co-Organizer of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/delhi-ruby/members/8777263/">The New Delhi Ruby Meetup Group</a> where I have taken various sessions. If you are in New Delhi and want to give a talk at the meetup, please give me a shout there.
